# Dashboard
A simple dashboard made in R as a final group project of an undergraduate course. 

Separated by 4 tabs, as in the image below and the dash visuals paste shows; there is a "sobre" (about); "cadastrar" (register); "estatísticas" (statistics); "comparações" (comparisons) tabs where the user can search for a certain product, register a new entry, see differences between cereals and even download the data bank.
